# widd-example

We provide an overview of the usage of Workflow integrated Data Documentation.

The project is intended for demonstration purposes and has the following materials included.

## How to use

1. Navigate to `analysis_repos.ipynb`
2. Navigate into a cell in Markdown format that you want to use for data documentation. 
3. Click on Snippets -> Markdown -> SAGE WIDD
4. Choose the relevant category that you want to add and describe.

### Problems

- How do you incorporate a button that creates a new sheet only containing these documentary questions and such a documentation sheet?
  + This connects to the question of what exactly the workflow is going to be. Working on a project, then by the way answering the data documentation questions and ultimatively create this documentation sheet? Append it to your notebook as a page? Everything is possible with javascript: so you have a .js program that searches all the sentences (maybe use fuzzy matching) of documentation within a notebook, then paste out everything below these headlines including the headlines and paste it into a new document. This is 100% possible, only to be answered is how. As an example, consider

### Ideas

- tick categories that you already added [x].
- move SAGE WIDD snippets into a singular dropdown (using custom js).
- make installation process more straight forward.
- create subcategories such that sub headlines are included as well with the first entry of a given sub category.
- create more sophisticated and complex cell that extends beyond merely using markdown headlines.
