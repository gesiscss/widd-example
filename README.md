We provide an overview of the usage of Workflow integrated Data Documentation.

The project is intended for demonstration purposes only.

## How to use

1. Navigate to `analysis_repos.ipynb`
2. Navigate into a cell in Markdown format that you want to use for data documentation. 
3. Click on WIDD -> SAGE WIDD
4. Choose the relevant category that you want to add and describe.
5. repeat steps one to five, but make sure to pick one cell per chosen item.
6. click "create WIDD"-button
7. name the md-file to be downloaded

- [] 90% percent functionality, but get to the "Wow"-effect
- ...
